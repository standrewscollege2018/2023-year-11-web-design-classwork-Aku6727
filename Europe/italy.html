    <h1>Italy</h1>
    <p>We struck Italy in the middle of a heatwave, yet still loved exploring the famous sights.</p>

    <h3>Venice</h3>
    <p>Venice, while crowded with tourists and a little smelly in places, is still an amazing place to visit.</p>
    <p>You need to get yourself lost in all the narrow streets and canals, and enjoy the hospitality of those few locals still left living on the island.</p>

    <h3>Amalfi</h3>
    <p>Amalfi is another one of those famous places you will see in thousands of photos but still have your breath taken away when you experience it first-hand.</p>
    <p>Another thing that can take your breath away is the insanely crowded, narrow and winding roads! Still, it is so beautiful that it is worth the driving stress.</p>

    <h3>Leaning Tower of Pisa</h3>
    <p>Marvel at all the tourists taking the obligatory photo of themselves "holding up" the famous tower!</p>
    <p>Interestingly, there was a failed terrorist plot to topple the tower the same day we were visiting.</p>

    <h3>Rome</h3>
    <p>What would any trip to Italy be without a visit to the Eternal City, Rome?</p>
